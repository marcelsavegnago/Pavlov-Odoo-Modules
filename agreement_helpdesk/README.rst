===========================
Agreement / Helpdesk Ticket
===========================

Odoo Agreement App does not provide an easy way to access helpdesk tickets
related to an agreement. Some organizations needs to have a quick access to
helpdesk tickets to track the performance of an agreement.

This module allows you to link a helpdesk ticket to an agreement and adds a
smart button on the agreement to look at the list of related helpdesk tickets.

Usage
=====

* Go to Helpdesk > Tickets
* Select or create a helpdesk ticket and set the agreement
* Go to Agreement > Agreements
* Open the previous agreement
* Click on the smart button "Tickets" to see the list of related helpdesk tickets
