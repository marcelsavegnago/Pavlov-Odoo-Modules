======================
External Systems (R&D)
======================

This module adds fields, form changes and functions for support integration with Pebbles and Houston.

Configuration
=============

#. User must have the 'External Systems Fields' checked on their user account to both configure URL's and edit the external fields on records.
#.   - Users that don't have this permission won't see the fields but will still see the 'Open' and 'Mimic' buttons.

#. Go to Settings -> General Settings -> External Systems
#. Set the MyAccount and the Houston base URL's. These are used for the buttons on records.

Usage
=====

#. Users without External Systems Fields permission: When a record has the external_systems_id field populated they will see a button that opens the related URL in either Pebbles (to mimic account) or Houston (to work with Locations or Products)
#. Users with External Systems Fields permission: Same as users without permissions but will also be able to configure the URL's and view and edit the externa systems fields on records.

#. NOTE: A page refresh is needed after applying the permissions.
